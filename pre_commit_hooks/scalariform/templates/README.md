# Scalariform code style preferences

Each one of these files is a different (slightly) preference for code formatting for each pillar.

While it would be ideal for everyone to use the same preference, the reality is that each pillar has varying amounts
of new and old code, and forcing a single standard on all pillars would create a lot of "formatting" PRs. Also no one
wants to herd the cats into style holy war.

# Format

The documentation for these preferences is here: https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform#preferences

Anytime ```[Scala Style Guide]``` is used it's referring to the settings at
[Scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform#scala-style-guide) which provide compliance with the
[Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/).

Please note that the settings are in ALPHABETICAL order (as opposed to the semi-random order on the wiki)

# History

* Connect (typically) experimented with the new tools and created this repo and the first template.
* Arcade was the second adopter and created the second template (since it was a new pillar at the time).
* Default was created by Connect and Arcade.
* All other pillars were duplicated from the Default template.
